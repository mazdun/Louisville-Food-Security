Measuring food insecurity accurately is challenging because it overlaps with a number of difficult-to-measure factors, like poverty, unemployment, median income and disability status. Also, those who are considered food insecure at one point in time might not be food insecure at other times. 

Often, individuals must make difficult (and ongoing) trade off decisions between paying for housing or transportation and buying nutritious food. The typical family of 4 (2 working adults and 2 children) in Louisville needs about **$76,491** each year after taxes (or \$94,375 before taxes) to achieve a living wage. These households spend about 13% of their yearly income on food. A greater share of their income typically goes to child care, transportation and housing.

Gaining a clear understanding of a community’s food ecosystem is essential to boosting its social and economic health. 

Here are three broad categories to gain a deeper understanding of the food ecosystem in Louisville and its peer cities:

* **Food Insecurity:** the percentage of the population who did not have reliable access to food over the past year
* **Food Access:** the percentage of the population who had some barrier to accessing food over the past year — income constraints, limited vehicle access, etc.
* **Food Environment:** an overview of the various places to buy food in Louisville and its peer cities

> **Key Takeaways:**

* In Louisville and its peer cities, the childhood food insecurity rate is much higher than the overall food insecurity rate. The COVID-19 pandemic further increased the share of children experiencing food insecurity. 
* Among its cohort of peers, Louisville is the worst performer in terms of households that do not have a car and live relatively far from a grocery store (more than 1 mile). Additionally, Louisville appears to be worsening over time, whereas its peers, on average, are improving. 
* Louisville is also the worst performer among its peers in terms of the share of households that receive SNAP benefits and live relatively far from a grocery store (more than 1 mile). It is worsening over time, whereas its peers, on average, are improving. 
* In general, Louisville has more access to healthy foods than its peer cities (with more grocery stores and farmers markets per 100,000 people). It also has fewer convenience stores. 
* Louisville needs about \$46 million annually to meet its current food needs. Its peers need about \$49 million, on average. 
* Nearly 31,000 people in the Louisville area are food insecure and do not qualify for federal food assistance.

# Food Insecurity {.tabset}

The food insecurity metric estimates how much of the population did not have reliable access to food during the past year. Those without reliable access to food tend to disproportionately suffer from diabetes and high blood pressure, among other negative health outcomes, according to Feeding America.

* **How Louisville's Currently Doing:** Nearly 13% of Louisville's population experienced food insecurity last year. That's better than most of Louisville's peers.  
* **How Louisville's Performed Over Time:** For much of the last decade, Louisville had largely been moving in tandem with its peers. Around 2018, it saw a decrease in its food insecurity rate. The city appears to have sustained those decreases during the pandemic, according to Feeding America projections. 

**More Context:** Feeding America uses a fairly detailed process to estimate food insecurity at the county level. First, it examines the relationship between food insecurity and several other factors (poverty, unemployment, median income, disability status, etc) at the *state* level using data from the Current Population Survey. Then, it uses the results of that analysis, together with poverty, unemployment, median income and disability status data at the county level to estimate food insecurity at the *county* level. 

## Ranking
*Note: For 2020 and 2021, Feeding America projected unemployment and poverty data since actual data is not available. Therefore, the food insecurity estimates for 2020 and 2021, which are built on the projected data, could fluctuate in future years.*

On the other hand, the food insecurity rate among children is significantly higher. Unlike the overall food insecurity rate, the child food insecurity rate has actually worsened in recent years.

# Child Food Insecurity {.tabset}

Food insecurity among children can be particularly devastating. It can lead to delayed development in young children and increase the risk of asthma, anemia, hyperactivity, anxiety and aggression in school-aged children, according to Feeding America.

* **How Louisville's Currently Doing:** Louisville currently ranks 9th in child food insecurity, with nearly 1 in 5 children experiencing food insecurity during the last year. 
* **How Louisville's Performed Over Time:** Around 2018, the child food insecurity rate rose dramatically in Louisville. Before that, it had been holding steady. Indianapolis is the worst performer of the bunch, with its child food insecurity rate rising 0.2 percentage points since 2014. Louisville is not far behind, having seen only a modest 0.4 percentage point decrease in its rate over the same time period.

# Food Access 

Here's a closer look at food access in Louisville. It includes the percentage of the population that is considered low-income and far from a grocery store, the percentage of households that do not have a vehicle and are far from a grocery store and the percentage of households that rely on certain food benefits and are far from a grocery store.

## Limited Access to Grocery Stores and Income Constraints {.tabset}

When looking at the food ecosystem, it's important to consider not only those who live far from a grocery store but also those who live far from a grocery store *and* live on a low income. 

* **How Louisville's Currently Doing:** Louisville currently ranks 6th on this metric, with about 21.4% of residents living with low incomes and far from grocery stores. That's about three quarters the rate of Louisville's currently worst performing peer city, Birmingham. 
* **How Louisville's Performed Over Time:** Louisville has seen its numbers stay fairly steady over the past five years of most recent data. Generally, over the same time period, Louisville's peers have been improving.

In terms of **race**, more than a quarter of White residents in Louisville have limited access to grocery stores, vs. 17.8% of Black residents and 15.6% of Hispanic residents. The numbers are significantly higher in Louisville's peer cities. However, it's important to note that this race data considers the *entire* population that is far from a grocery store (not just those living with low incomes). Therefore, the race data includes a percentage of the population that lives on a higher income and therefore can afford to drive greater distances to a grocery store. 

**What's considered far from a grocery store:** Anyone who is more than a one-mile walk or drive is considred far from a grocery store.

## Limited Access to Grocery Stores and Vehicle Access {.tabset}

It becomes significantly more challenging to access nutritious food at a grocery store if a household lives far away and does not have access to a vehicle. These households often must rely on public transportation or shop at stores that are closer to them that potentially have less nutritious food. 

* **How Louisville's Currently Doing:** More than 6% of Louisville's households live more than a mile from a grocery store and do not have a vehicle. That puts it in the bottom half of its peer cohort. 
* **How Louisville's Performed Over Time:** Louisville saw a sharp increase in the number of households without vehicles who live far from a grocery in 2017. That makes it sone of the worst performers of its peers.

**More Context:** In Louisville, about 10.4% of households overall do not have access to a vehicle, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Statewide, that number is 7%.

## Limited Access to Grocery Stores and SNAP Benefits {.tabset}

These are the households that live far from a grocery store and receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

* **How Louisville's Currently Doing:** 7.8% of Louisville's households receive SNAP benefits and live more than a mile from a grocery store. That puts the city in the middle of its peers.  
* **How Louisville's Performed Over Time:** Louisville's rate has decreased modestly over the past five years in which data is available. However, we don't have

# Food Environment

What does the food environment look like in Louisville? Here's a map of large grocery stores in Louisvilla and a breakdown of the number of grocery stores, supercenters, warehouse club stores, convenience stores, fast food restaurants and farmers markets per 100,000 people.

## Grocery Map

This map shows areas within a one-mile walk or drive of large grocery stores in Louisville. Most grocery stores are categorized as superstores because they sell a variety of consumer in addition to food, like clothes, cleaning supplies, and other household goods. Supermarkets are very large groceries, typically with 10 or more checkout lanes, while large grocery stores are other large food providers.

## Food Sources {.tabset}

The number of grocery stores, convenience stores and fast food restaurants has remained relatively constant since 2009. Even so, Louisville currently has more grocery stores per 100,000 people than its peer cities, on average. It also has significantly fewer convenience stores than its peers, on average. Louisville has slightly more supercenters and warehouse clubs than its peers.

**More Context:** The USDA defines each of these establishments precisely. Here are the definitions:

* Grocery stores are stores that sell canned and frozen foods, fresh fruits and vegetables and fresh meats. Deli-type stores are also included. Convenience stores, supercenters and warehouse club stores are not included.
* Supercenters and warehouse club stores sell groceries and general merchandise, like clothes, furniture and appliances.
* Convenience stores — also known as food marts — primarily sell milk, bread, soda and snacks. 
* Fast food restaurants are places in which customers order their food and pay before eating. Customers can consume the food at the store, take it out or have it delivered. Fast food restaurants can also sell alcohol. 
* Farmers markets are retail outlets with two or more vendors who sell agricultural products directly to consumers. (At least 51 percent of the retail sales must be direct to consumers).

# Tackling Food Insecurity

Currently, Louisville needs about \$46 million annually to meet the needs of its food insecure population, according to estimates from Feeding America. That's lower than the peer average of about \$49 million.

The budget shortfall in Louisville and its peer cities has decreased over time. It's important to note, however, that the percentage of people experiencing food insecurity has also decreased over this time. 

> **Bridging the Household Budget Gap:**

* Bridging this $46 million gap in Louisville (and similar gaps in other cities) is tricky. Government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), WIC program and school meal programs help some — but far from all — of the food insecure. 
* In Louisville, households can only make up to 200% of the federal poverty level to qualify for federal food assistance. In 2019, Feeding America estimated that 34.1% of the food insecure population in Jefferson County live in households that make *more than* 200% of the federal poverty level and therefore do not qualify for federal food assistance. That means that about 30,584 people in the Louisville area are food insecure and do not qualify for federal food assistance. Many depend on the charitable sector or other non-governmental sources to meet their food needs.

*Note: The budget shortfall in Louisville's peer cities is standardized to Louisville's total food insecure population in each year.*
